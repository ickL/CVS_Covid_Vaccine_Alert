# CVS_Covid_Vaccine_Alert
Using JSON file displaying current status of covid vaccine appointments on CVS website, play sound when there are available appointments
This script surveys the CVS JSON, converts to a pandas dataframe, and determines if there is availability at any site. If there is, it plays a sound. The script then sleeps for a configurable amount of time.
